Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than
any other operating system.
Linux has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems.
Linux is also the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and is used on 99.6% of the 
TOP500 supercomputers.
Many smartphones and tablet computers run Android and other Linux derivatives.
